# _Ping-Pong_

#### _Arrays & Looping Code Review for Epicodus, September 22, 2017_

#### By _**Kimberly Bordon**_

## Description

_This is a form that uses CSS to display lists of numbers, and the words "ping," "pong," and "ping-pong." With Javascript, it takes a number input, validates it, and creates an array based off a number and loops through that array to create the lists. If it recieves an invalid number, it displays an error message._
